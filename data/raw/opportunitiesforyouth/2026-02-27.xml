										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Sport for Peace and Safer Communities Initiative</strong> has officially opened its <strong>2026 Call for Participation</strong>, inviting organizations from <strong>Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala</strong> to join a structured Learning Community focused on Sport for Development (S4D). This initiative, implemented through a collaboration between the International Olympic Committee, the adidas Foundation, and GIZ, aims to strengthen social cohesion, prevent violence, and promote community peace through the power of sport.</p>
<p>The <strong>deadline to submit applications is March 16, 2026, at 11:59 PM (Colombia time)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Building Peace Through <strong>Sport for Peace and Safer Communities Initiative</strong></h2>
<p>The Learning Community (CoL) provides a platform for organizations to deepen their capacity to integrate Sport for Development and Peace approaches into their programs and organizational strategies. By connecting organizations with varying levels of experience in S4D, peacebuilding, and community development, the CoL promotes peer learning, technical accompaniment, and the exchange of knowledge.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_first_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->
<p>Participants will receive structured guidance, capacity-building workshops, and opportunities to co-design pilot initiatives. These pilots aim to demonstrate how sport can be used to strengthen social bonds, reduce violence, and support transformation in communities affected by conflict.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_second_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->
