Led by the <strong data-start="685" data-end="750">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</strong> under the <strong data-start="761" data-end="776">AIM4Forests</strong> initiative, the programme aims to strengthen youth-led solutions for forest protection, restoration, and sustainable forest management.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_page_title"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->
<p data-start="914" data-end="1212">The programme recognizes that young people in forest-rich countries are already driving change on the ground. By offering visibility, leadership development, and opportunities to engage with global forest processes, the initiative helps elevate local action to regional and international platforms.</p>
<h3 data-start="1214" data-end="1268"><strong data-start="1218" data-end="1268">About the FAO Young Forest Champions Programme</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1270" data-end="1681">The Young Forest Champions Programme is designed to showcase and support youth-led initiatives that contribute to sustainable forest management and climate resilience in the six participating countries. Through the programme, FAO connects young leaders to global discussions on forests, biodiversity, and climate, while ensuring that local experiences and perspectives inform international policy conversations.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_first_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->

<p data-start="1882" data-end="2193">Forests are essential for climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and the livelihoods of millions of people.

<p data-start="2195" data-end="2560">By investing in youth leadership in these contexts, the FAO Young Forest Champions Programme supports locally grounded solutions and strengthens youth participation in forest governance. The programme ensures that young people working directly with forest communities have a voice in shaping broader strategies and policies related to sustainable forest management.</p>
