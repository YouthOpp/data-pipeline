										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Women&#x2019;s Congressional Staff Foundation Scholarship (WCSF) aims to create the path to a career on Capitol Hill, when for many women, especially those from middle- and low-income backgrounds, the financial burden of living and working in Washington, D.C., can put these opportunities out of reach. Through its 2026 Scholarship Program, the Foundation is once again supporting aspiring female staffers and working to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace on Capitol Hill.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_page_title"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->
<p>Applications for the summer <strong>2026 scholarship are open now</strong>, with all materials due <strong>no later than 11:59 PM EST on April 15, 2026</strong>.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_first_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->
<hr />
<h2>Supporting Women With Women&#x2019;s Congressional Staff Foundation Scholarship</h2>
<p>The WCSF Scholarship is designed to ensure that more women from diverse backgrounds are able to access congressional internships&#x2014;positions that often serve as the entry point for long-term legislative careers. The Foundation&#x2019;s mission centers on broadening representation, elevating women&#x2019;s voices, and ensuring that the experiences of women inform the policymaking process from the very beginning.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_second_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->
<p>Beyond financial support, scholarship recipients gain access to a valuable professional network. Members of the WCSF Board provide mentorship, career guidance, and connections that can shape a recipient&#x2019;s long-term trajectory in public service.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why This Scholarship Matters</h2>
<p>Interning on Capitol Hill is an exciting opportunity, but it can also be financially demanding. The cost of housing, transportation, and basic living expenses in D.C. can quickly add up&#x2014;making internships inaccessible for many talented women. WCSF seeks to remove this barrier by ensuring that a student&#x2019;s economic background does not define her ability to serve.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="mid_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->
<p>By supporting early-career women at this pivotal stage, the Foundation strengthens the pipeline of future congressional staffers and leaders. Many previous recipients have gone on to full-time roles in congressional offices, political communications, public policy, and advocacy organizations. The program is not only empowering individuals&#x2014;it is reshaping the landscape of representation on Capitol Hill.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Deadline and Selection Timeline</h2>
<p>All application materials must be submitted by <strong>Wednesday, April 15, 2026, at 11:59 PM EST</strong>.<br />
Finalists will then be contacted to schedule interviews with members of the selection committee.<br />
<strong>Final scholarship awards will be announced no later than May 24, 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, and candidates are strongly encouraged to apply early.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="long_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->
<hr />

<p>Applicants must identify as a woman, be at least 18 years old, and hold a diploma from an accredited high school.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What the Selection Committee Looks For</h2>
<p>The WCSF committee evaluates applicants holistically, placing high priority on:</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="longer_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(131); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->

<li>Applications submitted for high-responsibility internships</li>

<hr />
<h2>Program Expectations</h2>
<p>Scholarship recipients are expected to complete the full internship described in their application. Withdrawing early or misrepresenting financial need may require forfeiture or repayment of funds, except in extraordinary circumstances approved by the Foundation&#x2019;s board. The award is tied to the specific internship listed in the application and cannot be transferred.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Empowering Women on Capitol Hill</h2>
<p>Through mentorship, financial assistance, and long-term professional support, the Women&#x2019;s Congressional Staff Foundation is shaping the future of equitable leadership in Washington, D.C. The 2026 scholarship cycle is an opportunity for emerging women leaders to take their first steps toward meaningful service and impact.</p>
<p>Women pursuing internships on Capitol Hill are encouraged to apply before <strong>April 15, 2026</strong>, and begin a journey that could define their careers for years to come.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-132" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="longest_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(132); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content -->

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Human-Centred Conservation Storytelling Grant invites experienced journalists and storytellers to rethink how conservation narratives are shaped, told, and understood. Too often, global conversations around conservation focus solely on wildlife or landscapes, overlooking the people whose lives are inextricably tied to ecological outcomes. This grant seeks to transform that narrative. By supporting high-quality, publishable stories that centre human realities in African conservation contexts, the program aims to elevate storytelling that is nuanced, responsible, and grounded in lived experiences.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_page_title"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->
<h2>About Human-Centred Conservation Storytelling Grant</h2>
<p>Conservation is never just about ecosystems; it is about the people who sustain, live within, and depend on them. The grant responds to a pervasive issue in public storytelling: narratives are frequently simplified, romanticised, or disconnected from crucial social, political, and economic dynamics. This initiative challenges that pattern by commissioning stories that reflect complexity rather than gloss over it.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_first_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->
<p>Human-Centred Conservation places people at the heart of every story. It considers how rights, livelihoods, governance systems, and cultural relationships shape outcomes on the ground. From land-use decisions to resource access, from coexistence with wildlife to health and economic pressures, the approach recognises that conservation is deeply intertwined with daily realities. Stories supported through this grant may highlight successful models that empower local communities or reveal what happens when people are excluded from decision-making.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_second_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->
<h2>What Kind of Stories Will Be Supported?</h2>
<p>The grant seeks strong, original ideas rooted in rigorous reporting and thoughtful examination. Ideal stories acknowledge that conservation is not linear. They explore where human-centred approaches drive positive change, where they fall short, and where tensions and trade-offs define everyday life. This includes stories that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showcase innovation, resilience, and hope led by communities</li>
<li>Illuminate challenges, contradictions, or unintended consequences</li>
<li>Investigate governance, livelihoods, coexistence with wildlife, food systems, or climate adaptation</li>
<li>Highlight land-use decisions shaped by cultural, economic, or political pressures</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no prescribed angle or format, allowing storytellers to work across print, film, photography, or audio. What matters is editorial maturity, depth, and respect for complexity. This grant is specifically designed for creators who already work to professional publishing standards and can deliver work suitable for established media platforms.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="mid_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->
<h2>What Will Not Be Funded</h2>
<p>To maintain high editorial integrity, the grant will not support promotional content, advocacy material, or simplified wildlife stories lacking a human focus. Narratives that present conservation as universally successful or universally failing, without acknowledging lived conditions and context, also fall outside the program&#x2019;s scope. Additionally, proposals requiring significant development support or capacity-building are unlikely to be selected, as this opportunity is intended for experienced professionals.</p>
<h2>Funding Tiers and What Applicants Can Expect</h2>
<p>Applicants may apply for one of three funding tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Up to USD 5,000</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Up to USD 8,000</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Up to USD 12,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Budgets must be realistic and proportional to the proposed story. The application process requires a concise pitch, previous work samples, details on likely publication or broadcast pathways, and a summary budget.</p>
<h2>Selection Criteria and Review Process</h2>
<p>A selection panel will evaluate applications based on the clarity and quality of the pitch, alignment with Human-Centred Conservation principles, evidence of professional experience, and feasibility of the budget. Not all eligible applications will receive funding, making clarity and originality crucial.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="long_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->
<h2>Key Dates</h2>
<p><strong>Applications open:</strong> 1 February 2026<br />
<strong>Deadline:</strong> <strong>23:59 GMT on 8 March 2026</strong></p>
<p>Applicants with questions may contact the organising team, though individual feedback on proposals will not be provided.</p>
<h2>A Commitment to Thoughtful, People-Centred Storytelling</h2>
<p>The Human-Centred Conservation Storytelling Grant underscores a powerful truth: conservation cannot succeed without understanding the people who shape and are shaped by it. By supporting storytellers who elevate these human dimensions, the program aims to contribute to more informed, inclusive, and impactful global conversations on conservation.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="longer_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(131); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Smithsonian Young Ambassadors Program</strong> (YAP) returns in 2026 with another year of transformative learning, cultural exploration, and leadership development. Hosted by the National Museum of the American Latino, this nationally recognized program empowers rising high school seniors across the United States and Puerto Rico to become community-conscious leaders through exposure to the Smithsonian&#x2019;s world-class resources. As the program enters another year, it continues to nurture the next generation of thinkers, creatives, and changemakers.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_page_title"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->
<hr />
<h3><strong>Smithsonian Young Ambassadors Program</strong><strong> Goals and Mission</strong></h3>
<p>YAP is designed to cultivate leaders in the arts, sciences, humanities, and civic life. The program promotes higher education by exposing students to a wide range of academic disciplines and introducing them to Latino role models in these fields. This representation is powerful&#x2014;showcasing diverse professional paths and inspiring students to envision their own futures in new ways.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_first_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->
<p>Another core goal is to provide hands-on learning environments that build strong 21st-century skills. Throughout the program, students gain experience in communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and professional development. These transferable skills prepare them for college life, internships, and future leadership roles, ensuring they leave the program confident and capable.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_second_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->
<hr />
<h3><strong>Washington Week Experience</strong></h3>
<p>A major highlight of YAP is the immersive <strong>Washington Week</strong> in Washington, D.C. During this once-in-a-lifetime learning experience, students participate in workshops led by leading scholars, museum professionals, and community advocates. They explore topics related to STEM, the arts, history, and culture while engaging directly with the Smithsonian&#x2019;s exhibitions and collections.</p>
<p>For many participants, Washington Week becomes a defining moment in their academic and personal journeys. The exposure to new ideas, the opportunity to connect with inspiring professionals, and the sense of belonging within a national institution create an unforgettable foundation for their future ambitions.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="mid_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->
<hr />
<h3><strong>Making History Community Practicum</strong></h3>
<p>Following Washington Week, students participate in the <strong>Making History Community Practicum</strong>, a key component that bridges their experiences in Washington with their communities back home. Through this practicum, students engage with local organizations, contribute to civic initiatives, and explore what it means to serve as ambassadors of their communities.</p>
<p>This hands-on involvement helps students understand how museums can function as spaces for representation, storytelling, and community engagement. It also instills a deep sense of civic responsibility, encouraging participants to view themselves as active contributors to the world around them.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Alumni Network and Long-Term Impact</strong></h3>
<p>YAP&#x2019;s impact extends far beyond the summer experience. The program maintains a strong and active <strong>Alumni Network</strong> that provides graduates with continued leadership development, mentorship, and professional opportunities. Many alumni go on to pursue degrees and careers in fields such as the arts, education, business, technology, and public service.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="long_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->
<p>The program&#x2019;s track record speaks to its success: a 97% college graduation rate, 354 alumni, 19 years of programming, and engagement across 18 cities throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. YAP alumni consistently serve their communities with creativity, confidence, and purpose, demonstrating the long-term value of the program&#x2019;s mission.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Application Details and Deadline</strong></h3>
<p>Applications for the <strong>2026 Young Ambassadors Program open on February 23, 2026</strong>, and will remain open until <strong>April 10, 2026</strong>. The program is open to rising high school seniors regardless of race or ethnicity. All programming is offered in English, and applicants are not required to speak Spanish.</p>
<p>Students interested in leadership, culture, and community engagement are encouraged to apply. With its unique blend of academic enrichment, cultural learning, and hands-on experience, YAP continues to be one of the nation&#x2019;s premier youth leadership opportunities.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="longer_content"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(131); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->

<h2 data-start="905" data-end="927">About David McClure</h2>
<p data-start="929" data-end="1239">David McClure was a highly respected journalist, news producer, and author whose career was defined by <strong data-start="1032" data-end="1063">deep forensic investigation</strong> and <strong data-start="1068" data-end="1104">public accountability journalism</strong>. Over a decade, he uncovered how the British Royal Family&#x2019;s private estates and investments were shielded from scrutiny for centuries.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2" data-placement-location="under_second_paragraph"></div><script data-ezoic="1">ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); });</script><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->
<p data-start="1241" data-end="1664">His investigations resulted in two landmark non-fiction books&#x2014;<em data-start="1303" data-end="1383">Royal Legacy: How the Royal Family Have Made, Spent and Passed on Their Wealth</em> (2014) and <em data-start="1395" data-end="1484">The Queen&#x2019;s True Worth: Unravelling the Public &amp; Private Finances of Queen Elizabeth II</em> (2020). These works were serialised in the UK press, described as <em data-start="1551" data-end="1576">&#x201C;bombshell revelations&#x201D;</em>, and covered extensively by global media. McClure passed away from cancer in June 2022.</p>
<h2 data-start="1671" data-end="1701">Why This Fellowship Matters</h2>
<p data-start="1703" data-end="1941">Funding for investigative journalism has been under sustained pressure for more than a decade.
