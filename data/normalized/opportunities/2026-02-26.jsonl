Running from June 15 to August 14, 2026 , this 9-week summer internship places selected participants inside Argentina s dynamic energy, technology, and industrial ecosystem. With structured projects in Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Process Improvement, Industrial Technology, and Operational Optimization , this program is especially relevant for U.S. STEM students seeking hands-on exposure to complex, high-impact environments beyond the classroom. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis , meaning early applications have a stronger chance of selection. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); Why the Argentina Internship Program Stands Out This is not a shadowing or observation-based internship. Participants work on real projects, meet real deadlines, and are expected to deliver real results. From day one, interns are immersed in professional teams where ownership, feedback, and accountability matter. The program is fully funded , covering: International flights Accommodation Daily meals Health insurance Immigration and visa support In-country transportation While the internship is unpaid, the value lies in the depth of experience, global exposure, and the ability to leave with measurable, provable skills rather than just a line on a CV. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); }); Areas of Experience Participants may be placed across multiple functional areas, including: Engineering (Upstream and Downstream Operations) Technology, Data Artificial Intelligence Industrial Operations Process Optimization Finance Economics Sales Marketing Energy Transition Placements are carefully matched based on each participant s academic background, interests, and career goals. Meet the Companies Interns will work with leading organizations operating at scale in high-complexity environments, including: Aeropuertos Argentina , managing major airport operations where logistics, safety, and efficiency intersect daily CGC , a key player in Argentina s hydrocarbon exploration and production Honeywell , delivering advanced solutions across aerospace, automation, and industrial systems Tecpetrol , leading energy development across the region Tenaris , a global leader in industrial manufacturing for the energy industry A global commodities trading company connecting vital resources through infrastructure, logistics, and financing These environments demand precision, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure exactly the skills global employers value. The True Learning Experience Participants learn by doing. Interns work inside professional teams, receive direct feedback, and collaborate across cultures. The experience rapidly builds independence, confidence, and global mindset qualities that differentiate candidates in competitive job markets. In addition to company placements, interns also: Connect with executives and industry leaders Visit universities and innovation hubs Experience Argentina s professional and cultural ecosystem beyond the workplace Life in Argentina Argentina offers far more than its global reputation for soccer. From world-class cities to diverse landscapes, the country combines cultural richness with professional intensity. Most activities are based in Buenos Aires , often called the Europe of Latin America, with additional site visits depending on company placement.

This national initiative supports nonprofits, Tribal entities, schools, and school districts across the United States and its territories that are working to ensure every child has access to nutritious, culturally relevant food both in schools and in their communities. Powered by Newman s Own Foundation , Humanitix , The Henry P. Kendall Foundation , and the Hunger to Health Collaboratory , the Prize aims to support innovative projects building a more just, inclusive, and sustainable food system for children. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); Why Food Justice for Kids Matters Across the United States, food insecurity remains a critical and urgent issue affecting millions of children. Today: ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); 1 in 5 children (14.1 million) live in households without consistent access to nutritious food. More than half of U.S. children do not consume enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Food insecurity is strongly linked to developmental delays, anxiety, depression, and long-term chronic health conditions. For children to learn effectively, grow physically, and thrive emotionally, they must have access not just to food but to nutritious, culturally meaningful, and sustainable food systems . The crisis is even more pronounced in Indigenous communities. Centuries of land dispossession and disruption of traditional food systems have led to disproportionately high levels of food insecurity among Native American youth, alongside increased risks of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Revitalizing Indigenous food sovereignty is therefore central to advancing food justice nationwide. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); }); The Food Justice for Kids Prize envisions a country where all children: Access nutritious, culturally relevant foods Learn about sustainable food systems Grow, gather, and cook food Experience nourishment physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually This is the second call for applications following the inaugural 2024 Prize recipients. Grant Amount and Funding Structure Selected organizations may receive: Up to $100,000 total Distributed over a two-year period Flexible funding (within program guidelines) Support from multiple co-funders Up to 14 organizations may be awarded. Funding can support program implementation, policy advocacy, and systemic change initiatives aligned with the Prize s mission. Focus Areas for 2026 1. Indigenous Food Justice This focus area supports projects and policy work that: Advance food sovereignty for Indigenous children and youth Reconnect children with traditional food systems Support gathering, growing, and cooking Indigenous foods Restore cultural knowledge related to food Organizations working with Native communities to rebuild local food systems, preserve cultural practices, and empower youth leadership are strongly encouraged to apply. 2. Nutrition Education School Food This focus area supports projects and policy work that: Provide nutrition education to children and youth Promote culturally relevant and healthy meals in schools Integrate local food systems into school programs Improve access to school meal programs Encourage hands-on food growing and cooking initiatives This category is not strictly limited to in-school programs; community-based initiatives aligned with school food access are also considered. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); }); Who Can Apply? Eligible applicants include: Nonprofit organizations Tribal entities Schools School districts Applicants must demonstrate: Alignment with food justice principles Innovation in approach Evidence of measurable impact Clear project goals (including SMARTIE-aligned goals) A feasible and well-structured budget Organizations do not need to be nominated to apply.
