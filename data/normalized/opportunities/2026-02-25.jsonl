From 2026 , one Fellow per year will receive 15,000 to complete an investigation that holds power to account and serves the public good. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); Presented by the Oxford International Centre for Publishing (OICP) at Oxford Brookes University , this Fellowship honours the legacy of acclaimed investigative journalist David McClure , whose work exposed centuries-old institutional privilege and reshaped public understanding of royal wealth and power. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); About David McClure David McClure was a highly respected journalist, news producer, and author whose career was defined by deep forensic investigation and public accountability journalism . Over a decade, he uncovered how the British Royal Family s private estates and investments were shielded from scrutiny for centuries. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); His investigations resulted in two landmark non-fiction books Royal Legacy: How the Royal Family Have Made, Spent and Passed on Their Wealth (2014) and The Queen s True Worth: Unravelling the Public Private Finances of Queen Elizabeth II (2020). These works were serialised in the UK press, described as bombshell revelations , and covered extensively by global media.
