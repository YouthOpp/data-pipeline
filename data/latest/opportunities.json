    "summary": "The global rule of law is under unprecedented strain. Long-standing models of legal cooperation and governance once shaped by post Cold War optimism are now being challenged by political polarisation, populism, and competing global visions of governance. In response, leading institutions are convening the next generation of legal professionals to rethink how the rule of law can be defended and strengthened in the 21st century. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); The International Law Fellows Network 2026: The Future of the Rule of Law in a Fractured World offers a unique opportunity for early- to mid-career lawyers to engage in this urgent conversation and develop practical strategies for safeguarding justice, accountability, and legal integrity worldwide.

However, those approaches are now facing mounting pressure: ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); In the United States , political attacks on courts and constitutional structures reveal internal vulnerabilities. Across Europe, democratic institutions are being tested by populism, executive overreach, and disinformation. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); Globally, rival governance models from Russia and China emphasize sovereignty and centralized control over accountability and individual rights. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); }); As these trends reshape global governance, rising legal professionals must grapple with how to uphold core principles fairness, equality, transparency, and justice in an increasingly complex world.
