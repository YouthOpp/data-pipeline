    "summary": "The LinkedIn Future of Work Fund 2026 is a global philanthropic grant initiative designed to help nonprofit organizations prepare young people for a rapidly changing labor market shaped by artificial intelligence. As automation and AI technologies continue transforming industries, LinkedIn is expanding its commitment to economic inclusion by funding organizations that help young adults successfully transition into an AI-powered workforce. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); The 2026 edition builds on LinkedIn s first year of funding nonprofit innovators worldwide and introduces an expanded funding round combining financial grants and in-kind support resources. The program focuses specifically on young adults facing structural barriers to employment and aims to ensure that technological transformation does not widen inequality. Why the Future of Work Fund Matters Artificial intelligence is not just creating new jobs; it is reshaping nearly every existing one. According to LinkedIn projections, approximately 70% of the skills required for jobs will change by 2030. This means traditional career preparation models are becoming outdated. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); The challenge is not simply training people to use technology. Instead, the workforce now requires a combination of: AI fluency and digital capability Critical thinking and adaptability Communication and collaboration Problem-solving in uncertain environments ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); Many young adults particularly those from underserved backgrounds lack access to training and opportunities that help them adapt to this shift. The Future of Work Fund exists to support organizations solving exactly this problem. What the Fund Supports The fund provides both financial grants and in-kind support to nonprofit organizations delivering programs that expand economic opportunity in an AI-driven labor market. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); }); Key Focus Areas Organizations applying must demonstrate a clear and practical approach to at least one of the following: 1. Preparing Young Adults for AI-Driven Careers Programs that teach AI literacy, digital skills, and workforce readiness for modern job markets. 2. Improving Job Access Initiatives helping career starters connect with employment opportunities using technology and AI-enabled pathways. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); }); 3. Supporting Workforce Success Training that helps young workers thrive after employment through adaptability, communication, and lifelong learning skills. 4. System-Level Workforce Innovation Projects influencing how education systems, training institutions, or employers integrate AI workforce preparation. What LinkedIn Means by AI Innovation LinkedIn is not only interested in teaching technical coding skills. Instead, the fund prioritizes organizations that combine technological learning with human capabilities. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(131); }); Supported initiatives typically include: AI-fluency training programs Career navigation tools powered by AI Skills-matching platforms Job readiness pathways Human-skill development (communication, collaboration, adaptability) Alternative credential programs Who the Fund Aims to Help The program focuses on young adults entering the workforce who face employment barriers. These may include: Individuals from low-income communities First-generation professionals Learners outside traditional university pathways Underemployed youth Career starters without professional networks ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(132); }); Typical target age range: 18 24 (varies by country) Eligibility Requirements for Organizations To qualify, applicants must meet all of the following conditions.

    "summary": "The global rule of law is under unprecedented strain. Long-standing models of legal cooperation and governance once shaped by post Cold War optimism are now being challenged by political polarisation, populism, and competing global visions of governance. In response, leading institutions are convening the next generation of legal professionals to rethink how the rule of law can be defended and strengthened in the 21st century. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); The International Law Fellows Network 2026: The Future of the Rule of Law in a Fractured World offers a unique opportunity for early- to mid-career lawyers to engage in this urgent conversation and develop practical strategies for safeguarding justice, accountability, and legal integrity worldwide. Why the Rule of Law Matters Now The United States and Europe have historically promoted rule-of-law frameworks through foreign aid, technical assistance, and policy conditionality. However, those approaches are now facing mounting pressure: ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); In the United States , political attacks on courts and constitutional structures reveal internal vulnerabilities. Across Europe, democratic institutions are being tested by populism, executive overreach, and disinformation. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(128); }); Globally, rival governance models from Russia and China emphasize sovereignty and centralized control over accountability and individual rights. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(129); }); As these trends reshape global governance, rising legal professionals must grapple with how to uphold core principles fairness, equality, transparency, and justice in an increasingly complex world. About the Programme This high-level programme is convened by Salzburg Global Seminar , the International Bar Association (IBA) , and the 21st Century Trust . It brings together early- to mid-career lawyers working in: Major law firms International organizations Public institutions Human rights and advocacy spaces ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(130); }); Participants will explore how their work in cross-border transactions, compliance, dispute resolution, and human rights law can help defend and adapt the rule of law in a fractured geopolitical landscape.
