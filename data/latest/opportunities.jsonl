As automation and AI technologies continue transforming industries, LinkedIn is expanding its commitment to economic inclusion by funding organizations that help young adults successfully transition into an AI-powered workforce. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); The 2026 edition builds on LinkedIn s first year of funding nonprofit innovators worldwide and introduces an expanded funding round combining financial grants and in-kind support resources. The program focuses specifically on young adults facing structural barriers to employment and aims to ensure that technological transformation does not widen inequality. Why the Future of Work Fund Matters Artificial intelligence is not just creating new jobs; it is reshaping nearly every existing one. According to LinkedIn projections, approximately 70% of the skills required for jobs will change by 2030. This means traditional career preparation models are becoming outdated. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(127); }); The challenge is not simply training people to use technology.

Supporting Workforce Success Training that helps young workers thrive after employment through adaptability, communication, and lifelong learning skills. 4. System-Level Workforce Innovation Projects influencing how education systems, training institutions, or employers integrate AI workforce preparation. What LinkedIn Means by AI Innovation LinkedIn is not only interested in teaching technical coding skills. Instead, the fund prioritizes organizations that combine technological learning with human capabilities. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(131); }); Supported initiatives typically include: AI-fluency training programs Career navigation tools powered by AI Skills-matching platforms Job readiness pathways Human-skill development (communication, collaboration, adaptability) Alternative credential programs Who the Fund Aims to Help The program focuses on young adults entering the workforce who face employment barriers. These may include: Individuals from low-income communities First-generation professionals Learners outside traditional university pathways Underemployed youth Career starters without professional networks ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(132); }); Typical target age range: 18 24 (varies by country) Eligibility Requirements for Organizations To qualify, applicants must meet all of the following conditions.

Long-standing models of legal cooperation and governance once shaped by post Cold War optimism are now being challenged by political polarisation, populism, and competing global visions of governance. In response, leading institutions are convening the next generation of legal professionals to rethink how the rule of law can be defended and strengthened in the 21st century. ezstandalone.cmd.push(function () { ezstandalone.showAds(119); }); The International Law Fellows Network 2026: The Future of the Rule of Law in a Fractured World offers a unique opportunity for early- to mid-career lawyers to engage in this urgent conversation and develop practical strategies for safeguarding justice, accountability, and legal integrity worldwide.
